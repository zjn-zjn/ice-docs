## Exchange discussion

ice is a lightweight, high-performance, and stable component-based process/rule engine that provides visual orchestration. Since it was open sourced, it has received feedback from many people and listened to these feedbacks for iteration and new feature development.

If you have questions in use, or want to consult and understand, you can join the group chat, and I will answer everyone's questions carefully.

Since the community group has increased to more than 200 people, **You can follow my WeChat official account, click <span style="color:red">personal WeChat</span>, and note <span style="color:red">ice</span> when adding friends, and I will add you to the group.**
