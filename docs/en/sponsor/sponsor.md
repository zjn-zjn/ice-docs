# Sponsor Ice Rule Engine

## Ice Rule Engine's Open Source Journey

Ice rule engine was officially open-sourced in 2022 and has continuously evolved and developed since then, growing from an initial idea to become a **visual rule engine and business orchestration framework** used by many enterprises.

### The Effort Behind Open Source

This represents a significant investment of spare time and energy:
- 📝 **Code Development**: Continuous iteration of rule engine core functionality
- 📚 **Documentation Writing**: Comprehensive Chinese and English documentation and user guides
- 💬 **Community Maintenance**: Timely responses to developer questions and feedback
- 🔧 **Bug Fixes**: Quick response and resolution of usage issues
- 🚀 **New Feature Development**: Developing new features based on community needs

### My Vision

I hope that through the Ice rule engine open source project, I can help more developers and enterprises:
- Make business rule management simpler
- Make rule engine technology easier to understand and use
- Promote the development of China's open source ecosystem

I will continue to improve Ice rule engine for the long term, with the goal of making it a **top-tier open source rule engine project**.
