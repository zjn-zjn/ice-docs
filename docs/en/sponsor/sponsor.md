ice was open-sourced in 2022, and since then it has continuously evolved and developed.

This undoubtedly represents a significant investment of spare time and resources.

I hope to help others through this open-source technical contribution, whether you use it to design systems, learn from it, or ask questions in the community.

I will commit to perfecting this project for the long term, and hope to elevate ice to the ranks of top-tier international open-source projects.
